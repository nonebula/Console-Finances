# Console-Finances
I was tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. I was  provided with a financial dataset and using that dataset I conducted an analysis.

## Description 
The goal of this project was to deliver a high-quality financial analysis of a dataset I was provided with. The dataset was composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses. I applied Javascript to construct process to solve:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Due to the nature of this project, there was no creation of html or css elements and I did not format the html page in any way other than was provided as a starter template.

## Credits

The project was completed independently but built off the source code from: edX Boot Camps LLC. I worked with my tutor, Juan Delgado, to identify issues and to format my code effectively. We also discussed how effective use of flexboxes has made my work more efficient.

In producing this webpage, I utilized a range of tutorials from W3 Schools and referred to several posts on Stack Overflow.
